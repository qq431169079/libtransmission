<h1>Libtransmission</h1>

<h3>Introduce</h3>

<p>This is the BitTorrent C library used by <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a>. 
Surely called 'libtransmission'</p>

<p>libtransmission is not introduced separately.</p>

<p>But it is really a good BT library, so I hack transmission's source code
and release it. </p>

<p>All Rights reserved by Transmission</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>Libtransmission depends on some third-party libraries,they are</p>

<pre><code>    libdht
    libudp
    libminiupnp
    libnatpmp
    libevent
    libcurl
    libopenssl
    Posix Thread
    zlib
</code></pre>

<p>And some of them, libdht, libudp, libminiupnp, libnatpmp are included in
the repository, while others not.</p>

<h3>Compile</h3>

<p>If you want to compile your code with libtransmission, do it like following
command:</p>

<pre><code>    gcc code.c -L. -ltransmission -ldht -lutp -lminiupnp -lnatpmp -levent -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto -pthread -lz
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you can put your code in another directory,
   and you know how to link libtransmission and it's dependencies.</p>
