W Downloader
===================

# Introduce
WDL is a download manager that supports FTP,HTTP and BitTorrent. It's developed by me years ago that I was still in school. So its implementation is bad.

WDL uses libcurl to download from FTP and HTTP, and uses libtransmission to download from BitTorrent.

I put it here just as a sample of libtransmission.

## Run

    ./src/wdl
