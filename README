libtransmission
=============

## Introduce

libtransmission is a [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorrent) Library written in C used by the famous BitTorrent Client [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/).

libtransmission is not released individually. I hack the source code of Transmission and make this library.
