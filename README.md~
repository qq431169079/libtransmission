Libtransmission
==========================

### Introduce

This is the BitTorrent C library used by [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/). 
Surely called 'libtransmission'

libtransmission is not introduced separately.

But it is really a good BT library, so I hack transmission's source code
and release it.

### Dependencies
Libtransmission depends on some third-party libraries,they are
		libdht
		libudp
		libminiupnp
		libnatpmp
		libevent
		libcurl
		libopenssl
		Posix Thread
		zlib

And some of them, libdht, libudp, libminiupnp, libnatpmp are included in
the repository, while others not.

### Compile
If you want to compile your code with libtransmission, do it like following
command:
		gcc code.c -L. -ltransmission -ldht -lutp -lminiupnp -lnatpmp -levent -lcurl -lssl -lcrypto -pthread -lz

Of course you can put your code in another directory,
   and you know how to link libtransmission and it's dependencies.
